# What is Transformer?
The Transformer is a deep learning model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by providing a new architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, rather than recurrent layers. This model is particularly effective for tasks like translation, text summarization, and more because it can process input data in parallel and capture complex dependencies in text.
